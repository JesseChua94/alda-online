# alda-online
Web editor for the music programming language Alda.

TODO
- Improve error handling and error response on subprocess calls
- Look into syntax highlighting (maybe even enforcement of syntax?) for editor
- Update styling for UI
- Improve responsiveness of UI
- Add Alda documentation and how tos + links to original Alda project
- Would be neat to improve audio player to use something like this for better customization: https://github.com/retrofuturejosh/react-modular-audio-player
